# Explanation

I took my ideas from here: #https://users.monash.edu/~lloyd/tildeAlgDS/Sort/Flag/

The algorithm is a well known algorithm by Dijkstra, 1976.



# Analysis

In each step either mid is increased, or hi is decreased, so the maximum complexity is O(n).

It requires no extra storage save two pointers, so O(1)
